1. The limits in your thoughts and words <br>
 If you think the way that you're used to, you'll do things the way you're used to. Focus on the transformation and the renewal of your mind . You will attract what you believe, what you attract is a representation of how you feel about yourself. Thoughts become words which become actions which become our character and then become our destiny.
<br><br>2. Limiting your impact <br>
Understand the universal law of sowing and reaping. Be conscious of the energy you are projecting and how you treat others. The starfish concept is to be committed to seeing who you can be of service to (On shore, there were MANY starfish out in the sand. A boy saw them all and started throwing them back into the water. A man told the boy "You can't save them all." The boys throws another starfish and says "It mattered to that starfish.")
<br><br>3. Limiting your character and personal development<br>
Personal development is the the way people assess their skills and qualities, consider their arms in life  and set goals in order to realize and maximize their potential.You  limit your character and personal development by not doing the work on yourself first.
<br><br>4. Limiting your ability to finish what you start<br>
You can limit how much you can get accomplished and actually finish what you start by allowing your pride to stop you from asking you for help. Don't carry extra burdens that you were not designed to carry. You will limit your ability to see the finish line by choosing not to push through the challenging times.
<br><br>5.Limiting the power of your dreams<br>
You limit the power of your dreams by thinking that you aren't capable of success, believing in the turtles and believing your fears and allowing your fears to paralyze you and lie to you. Your goals are what will help you evaluate your progress. Believe in that it is possible to achieve your dreams and accomplish things that you have never thought about accomplishing. Have faith in yourself and your dreams.
<br><br>6. Limiting your happiness<br>
You limit your happiness by allowing others to judge your success, YOU ARE THE JUDGE OF YOUR SUCCESS. Your happiness is not in the hands of someone or something else, that is too much power to give away. Be responsible in making yourself happy. Be true to yourself and you will be happy. There is room for everyone at the table of happiness and success.
<br><br>7. Limiting your capacity<br>
Capacity is all about the potential inside of you which essentially boils down to the existing possibilities.. Be that person who exhausts their potential and brings it in as your capacity. Discipline comes in as ounces, regret comes in as tons.
