  <h1>My 110%</h1>

    Have you ever wanted to do something, but didn’t have the courage to do it? I felt that way all throughout middle school. When I entered middle school, it was a loud, scary wake up call. Everyone was so smart and talented! It was a huge contrast from the underachieving students in my elementary school. Within the first week of school, I had shut up myself in my own world. I was not willing to try and be part of my class because I felt like I was out of everyone’s league.
    I felt like the class idiot. <br>
    When my fellow classmates tried to make conversation with me, I would push them away. I didn’t want to risk making an intellectual mistake and exposing myself as a fool.
    That was my problem- I refused to take risks. <br>
    I may have been academically low-ranked in my class and I may have felt less capable than the other students, but I really wasn’t. All I needed was a goal and a game plan. Knowing that my weakness was mathematics, in particular integrated algebra, I would go home and crack open the dusty algebra books lying around my home. My goal was to get 90 and above on my math tests.
    The day when we receive our test scores arrived and the teacher kept us in suspense about who got the 110% on the test. Everyone immediately thought it would be the girl who normally got the perfect scores in our class. The class went silent, and the teacher whispered “Tora”. My classmates clapped and cheered loudly, and first I didn’t know why. Eventually it clicked that they were applauding me! My hard work had earned me a 110%. <br>
    Continuing in that plan, I studied harder so that I might get into a specialized high school. The day my class got the results for the SHSAT (Specialized High School Admission Test), there were so many tears because so many kids didn’t pass. One of the friendliest, most high-spirited girls in our grade retreated into the closet with our jackets to cry. I was the only one who didn’t open my envelope with my results. No one in class had seen me cry before; I didn’t want that to change. One kid asked me why I wouldn’t open it. Then he said “Oh I know, you want to celebrate at home in secret!” He assumed that I passed. I nearly cried on the spot because of his certainty.
    The school day ended, and I still hadn’t opened it. As I walked home, my head hung down and I dragged my feet. The sky was gray. I was going to call my parents as usual and tell them I was safely on my way home, but realized I had lost my phone. My heart was so heavy at that point...When my parents found out that I failed and that I had lost my phone, they would flip. <br>
    Finally I arrived home and my dad asked for the envelope. He opened it and announced that I passed! <br>
    I must also add that those times studying for that test were by no means easy. I was and am still very slow when it comes to math. Many times I studied into the night. I spent many of those nights sweaty, shaking and doubting myself. The pressure made me cry sometimes. I just want you to know that you shouldn’t rely on luck. You really need to put in every bit of effort you can if you really want to achieve something.  As cliche as it sounds, you need to take risks and believe in yourself. No one can call you an idiot, not even yourself, if you give 110%.
